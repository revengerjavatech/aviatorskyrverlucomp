## Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

The Aviator game is easy to understand, but to maximize your chances of
winning, you should know the basics and a few strategies. Here's how you
can get started:

1.  **Place Your Bet**: Decide how much you want to wager on the game.
    You can choose to make a single bet or double bet (betting on two
    outcomes in the same round).
2.  **Watch the Plane Fly**: The game starts with an airplane taking
    off, and your goal is to cash out before the plane flies off-screen.
3.  **Cash Out at the Right Time**: As the plane flies higher, the
    multiplier increases. The longer you wait, the higher the potential
    payout. However, waiting too long can result in losing your bet if
    the plane flies off.
4.  **Use Strategy**: You can use automatic betting features, set a
    cash-out multiplier, or play manually to make the most of your
    strategy.

### Demo Mode: What Is It?

Aviator offers a **Demo Mode** for players who want to practice before
risking real money. The demo version mimics the real game but uses
virtual credits instead of actual money. It's perfect for:

-   **Learning the game mechanics**
-   **Practicing strategies**
-   **Testing different betting techniques**
-   **Building confidence without risking money**

While you won't win real money in demo mode, it's a great tool for
getting comfortable with the game and refining your skills.
